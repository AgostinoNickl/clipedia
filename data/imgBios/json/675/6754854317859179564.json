At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, Andre' Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Matisse's second version of \"The Dance\" signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.[43]"

The dance theme passed through several stages in Matisse's work prior to this canvas. Only here, however, did it acquire its famous passion and expressive resonance. The frenzy of the pagan bacchanalia is embodied in the powerful, stunning accord of red, blue and green, uniting Man, Heaven and Earth.[85]"
