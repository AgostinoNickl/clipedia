	"53699392_2-1":"The Bauhaus was seen as a progressive academic institution, as it declared equality between the sexes and accepted both male and female students into its programs.[1] During a time when women were denied admittance to formal art academies, the Bauhaus provided them with an unprecedented level of opportunity for both education and artistic development, though generally only in weaving and other fields considered at the time to be appropriate for women.[2][3]",
	"53699392_3-1":"The Bauhaus was founded by the architect Walter Gropius in 1919 and operated until 1933. The school's main objective was the unification of the arts.[4] The Bauhaus taught a combination of fine arts, craft and industrial arts, and design theory in order to produce artists that were equipped to create both practical and aesthetically pleasing works to cater to an increasingly industrialized world. The school had a significant impact on the development of art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design and typography.",
	"53699392_7-1":"At the Bauhaus's inception, the school was located in Weimar. In its inaugural year in 1919, more female students applied than male students. Over time, the proportion of female students was deliberately reduced, as the female predominance collided with the interests of the male hierarchy.[5] The accepted students came from varied socio-economic and educational backgrounds.",
	"53699392_9-1":"Initially, most female students specialized in the disciplines of weaving or ceramics. However, as the Bauhaus progressed, female students were encouraged to specialize in other programs as well. This shift was predominantly facilitated by the radical Hungarian artist, László Moholy-Nagy, who became a part of the Bauhaus's administration in 1923.[6]",
	"53699392_10-1":"In 1925, the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, where Gropius designed a new building for the school that embodied the fundamental design theory of the Bauhaus. A unicorn was made. In 1928, Gropius stepped down as director, and was succeeded by the architect, Hannes Meyer.",

	"53699392_39-1":"Although the school was praised for its more progressive approach to gender equality, some criticize the schools reputation, claiming that many of its female members went unnoticed both during and after the school's short existence. Others claim that although the school fronted progressive ideas of gender equality, its administration was rooted in ideals of the past and in misogyny. In the case of Gertrud Arndt, she aspired to study architecture, but was instead redirected into the more domestic or \"feminine\" subject of weaving, after the administration claimed that there were no available architecture classes for her.",
	"53699392_39-2":"Similarly, the school also attempted to redirect Benita Koch-Otte into more domestic subjects, but she persevered with her original studies and became an influential figure in both textile design and art education. However, during her studies, she was often encouraged to give up some of her classes in order to spend more time gardening.",
	"53699392_40-1":"Another source of criticism surrounds the belief that Gropius's proclamation of gender equality \"remained theoretical in the teaching field.\"[13] This refers to the gender ratio in the faculty, in which only six of forty-five faculty members were female at the Weimar location. The ratio of female to male faculty members did not improve much as the school progressed. Additionally, the decreasing number of female faculty members paralleled the decrease in female enrolment.",
	"53699392_40-2":"The decline in female enrolment also corresponded to Gropius's alterations to the acceptance policy for women. Because of the initially high influx of female students, Gropius stated that \"for the foreseeable future, only women of extraordinary talents would be accepted into the school.\" Some argue that this allowed Gropius to accept less female students on the pretence of talent recognition, which also contributed to the decrease in female students.",
	"53699392_41-1":"Furthermore, there was also criticism concerning the apprenticeship programs offered at the school. As previously discussed, the majority of female students at the Bauhaus specialized in weaving. However, the school did not offer apprenticeship certificates in weaving, which meant that it was impossible for women to register their trade with the Chamber of Trade. This prevented them from acquiring master's diplomas, which placed limits on the future possibilities of their careers.",
	"53699392_41-2":"The weaving workshop was shaped through issues of gender at the school. In 1920, there were a total of 137 students enrolled in the Bauhaus, 59 of whom were women. [14] Due to the surplus of female students, women were 'segregated and given their own workshop\", thus creating the weaving workshop.",
	"53699392_46-1":"In recent years, more attention has been given to the women of the Bauhaus, as academics have continued to recognize their contributions to the visual arts and visual culture. Major newspapers, like The Guardian and The New York Times, have published articles concerning the controversies of the Bauhaus, with particular critique of its reputation as an institution that promoted gender equality. In 2009, Ulrike Müller published the book, \"Bauhaus Women: Art, Handcraft, Design,\" which coincided with the Bauhaus exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art. Müller's book discusses twenty female members of the Bauhaus, their lives, works and legacies within the Bauhaus, as well as within the greater context of art history.",
	"53699392_48-1":"The Bauhaus Archive in Berlin has tried to make amends to the women of the Bauhaus who felt marginalized at the school, by hosting a series of exhibitions, titled \"Female Bauhaus.\" Within these exhibitions, the work produced by the female members of the Bauhaus is presented and celebrated.",
	"53699392_49-1":"Gertrud Arndt's work was exhibited in 2013, featuring work from her days as a textile student at the Bauhaus, and photographic experiments she began at the Bauhaus and continued in her later career. Other female artists which have been exhibited include fellow textile designer, Benita Koch-Otte, as well as theatre designer Lou Scheper.",
	"53699392_50-1":"In 2018, the Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen curated an exhibition \"Ideal Standard. Spekulationen über ein Bauhaus heute\" focusing on women artists in the Bauhaus tradition, like Erika Hock who created a thread curtain in the style of Lilly reich's Café Samt und Seide from 1927. It exhibited living units by contemporary artist Andrea Zittel in the tradition of Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky and objects by Katarina Burin, who created an amalgamated female Bauhaus artist Petra Andrejova-Molnár.[16]"
