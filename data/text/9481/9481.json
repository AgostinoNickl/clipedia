Erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern Germany (after Leipzig), as well as the public television children's channel KiKa.",
	"9481_3-1":"The city is on the Via Regia, a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network. Modern Erfurt is also a hub for ICE high speed trains and other German and European transport networks. Erfurt was first mentioned in 742, as Saint Boniface founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region and was a member of the Hanseatic League.[4] It was part of the Electorate of Mainz during the Holy Roman Empire, and became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802. From 1949 until 1990 Erfurt was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).",

	"9481_19-1":"The town is first mentioned in 742 under the name of \"Erphesfurt\": in that year, Saint Boniface wrote to Pope Zachary to inform him that he had established three dioceses in central Germany, one of them \"in a place called Erphesfurt, which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives.\" All three dioceses (the other two were Würzburg and Büraburg) were confirmed by Zachary the next year, though in 755 Erfurt was brought into the diocese of Mainz.[11] That the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence, which includes 23 graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries.[12]",
	"9481_20-1":"Throughout the Middle Ages, Erfurt was an important trading town because of its location, near a ford across the Gera river. Together with the other five Thuringian woad towns of Gotha, Tennstedt, Arnstadt and Langensalza it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the Via Regia was one of the most used east–west roads between France and Russia (via Frankfurt, Erfurt, Leipzig and Wrocław) and another route in the north–south direction was the connection between the Baltic Sea ports (e. g. Lübeck) and the potent upper Italian city-states like Venice and Milan.",
	"9481_21-1":"During the tenth and eleventh centuries both the Emperor and the Electorate of Mainz held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual \"Freizins\" (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's Juri-Gagarin-Ring).",
	"9481_21-2":"After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town (Sömmerda). Erfurt became an important regional power between the Landgraviate of Thuringia around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the Electorate of Saxony to the east.

	"9481_22-1":"In the year 1184, Erfurt was the location of a notable accident called the \"Erfurter Latrinensturz\" ('Erfurt latrine fall'). King Henry VI held council in a building of the Erfurt Cathedral to negotiate peace between two of his vassals, Archbishop Konrad I of Mainz and Landgrave Ludwig III of Thuringia. The amassed weight of all the gathered men proved too heavy for the floor to bear, which collapsed. According to contemporary accounts, dozens of people fell to their death into the latrine pit below. Ludwig III, Konrad I and Henry VI survived the affair.[13][14]",

The Erfurt Treasure with various gold and silver objects is shown in the exhibition in the synagogue today.[16] Only a few years after 1349, the Jews moved back to Erfurt and founded a second community, which was disbanded by the city council in 1458.Citation needed Because of their exceptional testimony to the life of a medieval Jewish community, the Jewish sites in Erfurt were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.[17]",
	"9481_24-1":"In 1379,[18] the University of Erfurt was founded.

Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the \"Latin Quarter\" in the northern city centre (like Collegium Maius, student dorms \"Georgenburse\" and others, the hospital and the church of the university).

	"9481_32-1":"In 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the Hammelburg Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered.",
	"9481_32-2":"In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the Electorate of Mainz and the city lost its independence.

	"9481_40-1":"Erfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate for territories Prussia lost to France on the Left Bank of the Rhine.[23][24] In the Capitulation of Erfurt, the city, its 12,000 Prussian and Saxon defenders under William VI, Prince of Orange-Nassau, 65 artillery pieces, and the Petersberg Citadel and Cyriaksburg Citadel Cyriaksburg, were handed over to the French on 16 October 1806.[25] At the time of the capitulation, Joachim Murat, Marshal of France, had about 16,000 troops near Erfurt.[26] With the attachment of the Saxe-Weimar territory of Blankenhain, the city became part of the First French Empire in 1806 as the Principality of Erfurt, directly subordinate to Napoleon as an \"imperial state domain\" (domaine réservé à l'empereur), separate from the Confederation of the Rhine, which the surrounding Thuringian states had joined.[27] Erfurt was administered by a civilian and military Senate[28] (\"Finanz- und Domänenkammer Erfurt\") under a French governor, based in the Kurmainzische Statthalterei, previously the seat of the city's governor under the Electorate.",

	"9481_42-1":"In 1811, to commemorate the birth of the Prince Imperial, a 70 ft ceremonial column (\"Die Napoleonsäule\") of wood and plaster was erected on the common.[30] Similarly, the \"Napoleonshöhe\" – a Greek-style temple topped by a winged victory with shield, sword and lance and containing a bust of Napoleon sculpted by Friedrich Döll[31] – was erected in the \"Stiegerwald\" woods, including a grotto with fountain and flower beds, using a large pond (\"lavoratorium\") from the Peterskirche, inaugurated with ceremony on 14 August 1811 after extravagant celebrations for Napoleon's birthday, which were repeated in 1812 with a concert in the Predigerkirche conducted by Louis Spohr.",
	"9481_43-1":"With the Sixth Coalition forming after French defeat in Russia, on 24 February 1813 Napoleon ordered the Petersburg Citadel to prepare for siege, visiting the city on 25 April to inspect the fortifications, in particular both Citadels. On 10 July 1813, Napoleon put Alexandre d'Alton, baron of the Empire, in charge of the defences of Erfurt. However, when the French decreed that 1000 men would be conscripted into the Grande Armée, the recruits were joined by other citizens in rioting on 19 July that led to 20 arrests, of whom 2 were sentenced to death by French court-martial; as a result, the French ordered the closure of all inns and alehouses.[32]",
	"9481_44-1":"Within a week of the Sixth Coalition's decisive victory at Leipzig (16–19 October 1813), however, Erfurt was besieged by Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops under the command of Prussian Lt Gen von Kleist.[33] After a first capitulation signed by d'Alton on 20 December 1813 the French troops withdrew to the two fortresses of Petersberg and Cyriaksburg, allowing for the Coalition forces to march into Erfurt on 6 January 1814 to jubilant greetings;[34][35] the \"Napoleonsäule\" ceremonial column was burned and destroyed as a symbol of the citizens' oppression under the French;[36] similarly the \"Napoleonshöhe\" was burned on 1 November 1813 and completely destroyed by Erfurters and their besiegers in 1814.

During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the \"Royal Gun Factory of Prussia\" in 1862. After the Unification of Germany in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed.",
	"9481_53-2":"The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly.
